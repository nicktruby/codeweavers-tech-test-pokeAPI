This was my submitted tech test to one of the positions I applied for within 1-3 months of finishing my bootcamp software development course at _nology in December 2020.

I've not made changes since (other than this readme) so It's a good example of my skills at that time.

# PokéAPI Directory 

## Prerequisite
This task needs to be completed using both Angular and Bootstrap (already included in package.json).  

You can install additional packages if you desire.

There are no wireframes or designs attached, use your own creative flair!

## Brief
Using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) we would like you to create a Pokémon directory allowing users to browse all available Pokémon.

### Minimum Requirements
Build an SPA to list all available Pokémon and view each in greater detail.

#### Step 1
 Use the [GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon) to build a page that will list all available Pokémon.
 
_**Hint**: This API can be called without an `{id or name}` to return a paginated resource list, see more information on that [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#resource-listspagination-section)._

- This page should allow the user to navigate through the result in blocks of 50.
- This page should be reloadable and shareable. For example, sharing or reloading `https://myapp.co.uk/pokemon-directory?page=4` should hydrate the UI correctly showing the Pokémon results 150-200.

#### Step 2
Use the [GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon) to build a page displaying information about the Pokémon.
- This page should be accessed by clicking a Pokémon result from step 1.
- This page should be reloadable and shareable. For example, sharing or reloading `https://myapp.co.uk/pokemon/{id}` should hydrate the UI correctly with the details for the Pokémons ID in the app URL.

### Non Mandatory Requirements
If you're enjoying the task and want to show off, use any other additional PokéAPI(s) to add more functionality and/or information to your application. 


### Getting Started
#### Install Dependencies
`npm install`
#### Serve Project
`ng serve`

This is the easiest way to run and develop your app locally.
